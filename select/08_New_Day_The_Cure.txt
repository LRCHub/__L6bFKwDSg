Shout
New day
New day
In heaven the ground is waiting
For the dust

The seed
My love once more

I shout (shout)

New day
New day

Hold the air and gasp in life
This solid dance
This cold cold night
Is gone... (is gone)

The dark heat throbs
The fools' sweat swims
The hazy lights

The deadly sins
Are gone... (are gone)

Crack the stone
Invade my head
Dropping honey dropping dead again (again)
The silence shouts
Across the gap
Another dreaming
Love me again...
Love me again...
Shout!
Shout!
Shout!
(Love me again...)
Shout!
Shout!
Shout!
