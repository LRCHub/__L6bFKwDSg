Last night I had a dream that the world was changin'
Changin' by leaps and bounds
It started up in the bigger cities
And it's spread to the smaller towns

And the people began to smile at people
They'd never even seen
And when Jeremiah woke me up this morning
I was ready to live that dream

It's a brand new day
It's brand new way
Yeah, it's a brand new day
It's brand new way

Mother called father on the telephone
Because she was upset
She said, "The boy left home, naked this mornin'
All he took was the TV set"

And then the sister picked up the extension
And she said, â€½He's just doin' his thingâ€
And then the father hung up on the mother
And all the children began to sing

It's a brand new day
Doin' in a brand new way
Mama, it's a brand new day
We're doin' in a brand new way

We gotta put our heads together
And see where we go from here
We gotta fight for what we believe in
'Cause there's somethin' in the air

It's a brand new day
We're doin' in a brand new way
Mama, it's a brand new day
We're doin' in a brand new way

Twenty million shadows stormin' at the gates
How can we be surprised
With the image of their fallen kings
Reflected in their eyes

And the twenty million tongues are shoutin' now
It's only heard by a precious few
But the years of night are gonna pass forever
When the sun comes shinin' through

On a a brand new day
We're doin' in a brand new way
It's a brand new day
We're doin' in a brand new way

Mama, it's a brand new day
And you have had your way
Mama, how we're doin' in a brand new way
And you have had your way

It's a brand new day
We're doin' in a brand new way
We're gonna do it our way
